# Reflection

- I learned a lot on how to manipulate existing HTML elements on the DOM, as well as to dynamically create new elements.
- I found that giving ids to HTML elements that need to be modified as the game runs was why ids are so important.
- Initially, I was set on using classes but quickly realized that using ids woud allow me to uniquely identify the HTML element of interest.
- Despite seeming like a simple game, my hangman game was more complicated than I originally foresaw.
- The game was programmed procedurally rather than by an object oriented system. This was done more for personal convenience. However, I realized later on that using objects would have been more efficient at managing the game state.
- ChatGPT was used for general HTML/CSS/JS questions, such as how to access a particular DOM element that was a child or grandchild of some parent, how to modify a certain CSS style via JS, how to center a div (for the thousandth time), or how to periodically call a function every x milliseconds, etc.
- Using AI allowed helped me save time I would have spent long periods of time googling and allowed me to focus my efforts on other features of the game.
